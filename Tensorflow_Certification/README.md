```
Teaching practies for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning.
```


## 코스1: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

```
- Andrew Ng teach foundational principles of ML, DL
- How to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can sart building and applying scalable models
to real-world problems.
- To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, we recommend that you take the DL
```

1. WK1: A New Programming Paradigm
2. WK2: Introduction to Computer Vision
3. WK3: Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks
4. WK4: Using Real-world Images


## 코스2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

```
- Andvanced techniques to improve the computer vision mdel you bulit in Course 1. 
- How to work with real-world images 
  - in different shapes and sizes, 
  - visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information
  - plot loss and accuracy
  - explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout. 
- Transfer Learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.
```

1. WK1: Exploring a Larger Dataset
2. WK2: Augmentation: A technique to avoid overfitting
3. WK3: Transfer Learning
4. WK4: Multiclass Classifications


## 코스3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
```
- You will build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow. 
- You'll learn to process text, including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors so that they can be input to a neural network. 
- You’ll also learn to apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow. 
- you’ll get to train an LSTM on existing text to create original poetry! 
```

1. WK1: Sentiment in text
2. WK2: Word Embeddings
3. WK3: Sequence models
4. WK4: Sequence models and literature



## 코스4: Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
```
- You will learn how to build time series models in TensorFlow. 
- You’ll first implement best practices to prepare time series data. 
- You’ll also explore how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. 
- Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!
